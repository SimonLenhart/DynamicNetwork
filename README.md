Repository for the software project "Teamwise extention for dynamic networks".

The development of this project was part of the course "Software Project" at the University of Konstanz. 
The goal was to develop an extention for TEAMWISE (Tool for Exploration and Analysis of Movement data within Immersive Synchronised Environments)
, which uses the Cesium platform (https://cesiumjs.org/). Cesium is a web application quite similar to Google Earth. 
By loading already existing animal movement data, a dynamic network was created and further visualized and analysed. 
The whole project was realized by @SimonLenhart in cooperation with three other students.
